Large
terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia

</p>

<p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae"
>Elephantidae</a> in the order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea"
>Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant"
>African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>), the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant" >African
    forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"
>Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered
    throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" >sub-Saharan
        Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" >South
        Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia" >Southeast
        Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now
    extinct, members of the order include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae"
    >deinotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere"
    >gomphotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth" >mammoths</a>,
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon" >mastodons</a>.
</p>
<p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also
    called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis" >proboscis</a>),
    used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor" >incisors</a> grow into tusks,
    which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"
    >pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have
    larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
    backs.
</p>
<p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna"
>savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh"
>marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" >keystone
    species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their
    distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"
    >lions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger" >tigers</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena" >hyenas</a>, and any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae"
    >wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants
    have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society" >fission–fusion
        society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows")
    tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
    related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy"
    >matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.
</p>
<p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with
    other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a
    state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" >testosterone</a>
    and aggression known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth" >musth</a>,
    which helps them gain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)" >dominance</a>
    and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on
    their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They
    communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"
    >infrasound</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication"
    >seismic communication</a> over long distances. Elephant <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition" >intelligence</a>
    has been compared with that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate" >primates</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea" >cetaceans</a>. They appear
    to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness" >self-awareness</a>
    and show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy" >empathy</a> for dying
    or dead individuals of their kind.
</p>
<p>African elephants are listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species" >vulnerable</a>
    by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature"
    >International Union for Conservation
        of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"
    >endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant
    populations is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade" >ivory
        trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" >poached</a>
    for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction"
    >habitat destruction</a> and conflicts with local people.
    Elephants are used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal" >working
        animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
    controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus"
    >circuses</a>. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in
    art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word "elephant" is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" >Latin</a>
    <i>elephas</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive"  >genitive</a>
    <i>elephantis</i>) ("elephant"), which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names"
    >Latinised</a> form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"
    >Greek</a> ἐλέφας (<i>elephas</i>) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (<i>elephantos</i>)),<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-LSJ-1">[1]</a></sup>
    probably from a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages" >Indo-European</a>
    language, likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language" >Phoenician</a>.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-etymology-2">[2]</a></sup>
    It is attested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greek" >Mycenaean
        Greek</a> as <i>e-re-pa</i> (genitive <i>e-re-pa-to</i>) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B"

    As in Mycenaean Greek, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer" >Homer</a>
    used the Greek word to mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory" >ivory</a>,
    but after the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus" >Herodotus</a>,
    it also referred to the animal.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-LSJ-1">[1]</a></sup>
    The word "elephant" appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English" >Middle
        English</a> as <i>olyfaunt</i> (c.1300) and was borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French"

    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant" >Loxodonta</a></i>,
    the generic name for the African elephants, is Greek for "oblique-sided tooth".<sup

    >Pliocene</a> boundary while <i>Mammuthus</i> and <i>Elephas</i> diverged

    another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the

<p>Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest
    species, with males typically being 3.20&nbsp;m (10.50&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and
    6,000&nbsp;kg (13,200&nbsp;lb) while females stand 2.60&nbsp;m (8.53&nbsp;ft) tall at the
    shoulder with a body mass of 3,000&nbsp;kg (6,600&nbsp;lb). Male Asian elephants are usually
    about 2.75&nbsp;m (9.02&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and 4,000&nbsp;kg (8,800&nbsp;lb) whereas
    females are 2.40&nbsp;m (7.87&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and 2,700&nbsp;kg (6,000&nbsp;lb).
    African forest elephants are the smallest species, usually being around 2.20&nbsp;m
    (7.22&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder and 2,000&nbsp;kg (4,400&nbsp;lb). Male African elephants
    are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller
    than females.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Larramendi,_A._2015-46">[46]</a></sup>
    The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani68-62">[62]</a></sup>
    The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African
    elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the
    tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating
    arches that protect the brain in every direction.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> The skull
    contains air cavities (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)" >sinuses</a>)
    that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the
    inside of the skull a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb" >honeycomb</a>-like
    appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of
    muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani68-62">[62]</a></sup>
    Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-evolution-44">[44]</a></sup>
    Lacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_apparatus" >lacrimal
        apparatus</a>, the eye relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harderian_gland"
    >harderian gland</a> to keep it moist. A durable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nictitating_membrane"
    >nictitating membrane</a> protects the eye globe. The animal's
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view" >field of vision</a>

<p>Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"

    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary" >capillaries</a>.
    Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the
    environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by
    flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of
    all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest
    ear flaps.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

<h3>Trunk</h3>
<p>The trunk, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis" >proboscis</a>,
    is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus"
    >fetal</a> life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-evolution-44">[44]</a></sup>
    The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile
    appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_fascicle"
    >muscle fascicles</a>, with no bone and little fat. These paired
    muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided
    into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsoventral"  >dorsals,
        ventrals</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_and_medial"
    >laterals</a> while the latter are divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_plane"
    >transverse</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/radiate"
    >radiating</a> muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect

<p>Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor" >incisors</a>,
    known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusk" >tusks</a>, 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous_teeth"
    >deciduous</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"
    >premolars</a>, and 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"
    >molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_development"
    >grow baby teeth</a> and then replace them
    with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyodont"
    >polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their
    lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not
    replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth
    grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing
    tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second
    set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years
    of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the
    early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life.
    Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in
    African elephants.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani70-76">[76]</a></sup>

<h4>Tusks</h4>

></a>Asian elephant eating tree bark,

<p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_teeth"  >milk
        teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) a
    year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"
    >enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"
    >dentine</a> is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory" >ivory</a>
    and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)" >cross-section</a>
    consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped
    areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite" >calcite</a>. Much of the tusk
    can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk
    contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)" >pulp</a>
    and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without
    harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist.
    Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking
    or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they
    are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">[77]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Like humans, who are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness" >right-
    or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called
    the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the
    African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length
    in both sexes, reaching up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft),<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">[77]</a></sup>
    but those of males tend to be thicker.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>
    In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&nbsp;kg) were not
    uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45&nbsp;kg).<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or
    none at all.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani71-77">[77]</a></sup>
    Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
    Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the
    largest recorded was 3.02&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) long and weighed 39&nbsp;kg (86&nbsp;lb). Hunting

<p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) thick on the back and
    parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"
    >anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically
    have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud.
    Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and
    the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back.
    As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair
    and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ"
    >genitals</a> and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the
    skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<sup

<p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"
>ultraviolet</a> light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very
    sensitive. Without regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_bath" >mud
        baths</a> to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin
    suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust
    onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat
    through the skin because of their low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio"
    >surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times
    smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in
    an effort to expose their soles to the air.<sup  ><a

<p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the
    body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellous_bone"
    >cancellous bone</a> in place of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medullary_cavity"
    >medullary cavities</a>. This strengthens the bones while still

    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani69-88">[88]</a></sup>
    Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the
    front.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-cushion-89">[89]</a></sup>
    Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand
    still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating
    their front legs, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna" >ulna</a> and

    The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or "cushion pads" beneath the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_(anatomy)"
    >manus</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pes_(anatomy)"
    >pes</a>, which distribute the weight of the animal.<sup

    They appear to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamoid_bone" >sesamoid</a>,
    an extra "toe" similar in placement to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"

<p>Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trot"
>trot</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping" >jump</a>,
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait" >gallop</a>. They use
    only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani69-88">[88]</a></sup>
    In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the
    foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the
    criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with
    the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-kinetics-92">[92]</a></sup>
    Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs
    and can reach a top speed of 25&nbsp;km/h (16&nbsp;mph).<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ReferenceA-93">[93]</a></sup>
    At this speed, most other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupedalism" >quadrupeds</a>
    are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the
    difference between the motion of elephants and other animals.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ReferenceA-93">[93]</a></sup>
    During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise

<p>The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5&nbsp;kg (10–12&nbsp;lb) compared to 1.6&nbsp;kg
    (4&nbsp;lb) for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally
    smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrum"
    >cerebrum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum" >cerebellum</a>
    are well developed, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe" >temporal

</p>
<p>The heart of an elephant weighs 12–21&nbsp;kg (26–46&nbsp;lb). It has a double-pointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_of_the_heart"
>apex</a>, an unusual trait among mammals.<sup
><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">[68]</a></sup>
    In addition, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)" >ventricles</a>
    separate near the top of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Marshall_Cavendish-95">[95]</a></sup>
    When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other
    animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>
    The blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood
    pressures.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Marshall_Cavendish-95">[95]</a></sup>
    The lungs are attached to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm" >diaphragm</a>,
    and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.<sup

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue" >Connective
        tissue</a> exists in place of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleural_cavity"

    pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air,<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-snorkel-53">[53]</a></sup>
    although this explanation has been questioned.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>
    Another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through
    the trunk.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-snorkel-53">[53]</a></sup>
    Elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. They have
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindgut_fermentation" >hindgut
        fermentation</a> system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35&nbsp;m
    (115&nbsp;ft) in length. The majority of an elephant's food intake goes undigested despite the
    process lasting up to a day.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani78-68">[68]</a></sup>

    length of 100&nbsp;cm (39&nbsp;in) and a diameter of 16&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) at the base. It is
    S-shaped when fully erect and has a Y-shaped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_urethral_orifice_(male)"
    >orifice</a>. The female has a
    well-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris" >clitoris</a>

    African elephants are mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing_(herbivory)" >browsers</a>
    while Asian elephants are mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing" >grazers</a>.
    They can consume as much as 150&nbsp;kg (330&nbsp;lb) of food and 40&nbsp;L
    (11&nbsp;US&nbsp;gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani42-23">[23]</a></sup>
    Major feeding bouts take place in the morning, afternoon and night. At midday, elephants rest

    Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Siegel-103">[103]</a></sup> Both
    males and family groups typically move 10–20&nbsp;km (6–12&nbsp;mi) a day, but distances as far

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> Elephants
    go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water, minerals, and mates. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobe_National_Park"

</p>
<p>Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are
    considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species" >keystone
        species</a>. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into
    grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by
    other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elgon"
    >Mount Elgon</a>, elephants excavate caves that are used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate"
    >ungulates</a>, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani226-107">[107]</a></sup>
    Elephants are important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal" >seed
        dispersers</a>; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect
    or a positive effect on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination" >germination</a>.
    The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup>
    In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros"
    >rhinoceros</a> for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot
    be filled by the next largest herbivore, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_tapir"
    >tapir</a>.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup>
    Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other
    animals, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dung_beetle" >dung
        beetles</a> and monkeys.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani226-107">[107]</a></sup>
    Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_Falls_National_Park"
    >Murchison Falls National Park</a> in Uganda, the
    overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on
    woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff"

    Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode"

<p>Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality"
>matrilineal</a> family groups, some of which are made up of more
    than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy"
    >matriarch</a> which is often the eldest female.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">[116]</a></sup>
    She remains leader of the group until death<sup  ><a

    if she no longer has the energy for the role;<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Kingdon53-117">[117]</a></sup> a
    study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosterone"
    >corticosterone</a> ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the
    surviving elephants.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>
    When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if
    her sister is present.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-African-112">[112]</a></sup>
    The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In
    the case of elephants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amboseli_National_Park" >Amboseli
        National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans,
    and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as
    bond groups. These are typically made of two family groups,<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">[116]</a></sup>
    which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split
    after becoming too large for the available resources.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> During the
    dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social
    organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they
    defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan.
    The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral"
    subpopulations.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar175-116">[116]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There
    appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have
    "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain
    family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of
    one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females
    plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller
    family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.
    Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three
    offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<sup

></a>Lone bull: Adult male elephants
spend much of their time alone or in single-sex groups



<p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at
    the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli,
    young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When
    males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of
    bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two
    or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of
    over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to
    144 individuals.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">[121]</a></sup>
    These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form
    long-term relationships.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-O&#39;Connell-Rodwell-122">[122]</a></sup>
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy" >dominance
        hierarchy</a> exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">[121]</a></sup>
    and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the
    company and leadership of older, more experienced males,<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-O&#39;Connell-Rodwell-122">[122]</a></sup>

<p>Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"
>testosterone</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth"
>musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the
    age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24
    do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls
    appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it
    during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid
    secreted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporin" >temporal
        gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_sheath" >sheath</a>, which
    causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking
    with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling
    and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar100-124">[124]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour"
>agonistic</a> encounters when the individuals have the same
    condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of
    the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when
    he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other.
    Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the
    tusks. Serious fights are rare.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar100-124">[124]</a></sup>

    breeders,<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup>

    oestrus releases chemical signals (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone" >pheromones</a>)
    in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a
    potential mate and assess her condition with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response"
    >flehmen response</a>, which requires the male to collect a
    chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ"

    The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicular_phase"
    >follicular phase</a> and an 8- to 10-week <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteal_phase"
    >luteal phase</a>. While most mammals have one surge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone"
    >luteinizing hormone</a> during the follicular phase, elephants
    have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus
    by changing her scent, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation" >ovulation</a>
    does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> Fertility
    rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.<sup  ><a

<p>Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and
    defend them from other males.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup>
    Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them,
    particularly older ones.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup>
    Thus these bulls have more reproductive success.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar179-121">[121]</a></sup>
    Musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not
    have normal musths.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation" >Gestation</a> in elephants
    typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years.
    Births tend to take place during the wet season.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> Calves are
    born 85&nbsp;cm (33&nbsp;in) tall and weigh around 120&nbsp;kg (260&nbsp;lb).<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani106-133">[133]</a></sup>
    Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-pregnancy-140">[140]</a></sup><sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup>
    The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_luteum"
    >corpus luteums</a> (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the
    foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-pregnancy-140">[140]</a></sup>
    As such, newborn elephants are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial"
    >precocial</a> and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and
    family herd.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">[142]</a></sup>
    A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other
    young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the
    first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloparenting"
    >Alloparenting</a> – where a calf is cared for by someone other than
    its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years
    old.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani106-133">[133]</a></sup>
    When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its
    mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise
    control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of
    life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month,
    a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk
    and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close
    to her.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">[142]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after
    which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same
    time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same
    rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding.
    By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's
    abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for
    nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last
    2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three
    years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body
    condition and reproductive ability.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar126-142">[142]</a></sup>

></a>Asian elephants greeting each other
by inter-twining their trunks



<p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by
    stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older
    elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age
    and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during
    meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is
    especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch
    their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is
    behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it
    wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more
    threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by
    shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are
    usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks.
    Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their
    necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Elephants produce several sounds, usually through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"
>larynx</a>, though some may be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_resonation"
>modified</a> by the trunk.<sup
><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani120-149">[149]</a></sup>

camera



<p>At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is
    emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact
    calls are soft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation" >unmodulated</a>
    sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to
    with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble
    is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to
    another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the
    "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated
    chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow
    after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the
    "mating pandemonium".<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar145-151">[151]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Elephants are known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication" >communicate
    with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical
    waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit
    the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put
    more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants
    possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet
    contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal"
    >marine mammals</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothed_whale"
    >toothed whales</a> and sirenians. A unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"
    >sphincter</a>-like muscle around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_canal"
    >ear canal</a> constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic
    signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-seismic-154">[154]</a></sup>
    Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock
    charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>
    When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter
    a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by
    locomotion appear to travel distances of up to 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;mi) while those from
    vocalisations travel 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi).<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup>

    >western Africa</a>. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in
    the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant
    populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated,
    and savannah populations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon" >Cameroon</a>
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia" >Somalia</a> experienced a
    decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern

<p>African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found,

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching" >poaching</a> of elephants
    for their ivory, meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-IUCN2-170">[170]</a></sup>
    Historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and
    its use rivalled that of gold.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani202-172">[172]</a></sup>
    The ivory trade contributed to the African elephant population decline in the late 20th
    century.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-IUCN-165">[165]</a></sup>
    This prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the United States in June
    1989, and followed by bans in other North American countries, western European countries, and
    Japan.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani202-172">[172]</a></sup>
    Around the same time, Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ivory-173">[173]</a></sup> CITES
    approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in January 1990. Following the
    bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important
    economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able
    to adapt and were not badly affected.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani202-172">[172]</a></sup>
    Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi" >Malawi</a>
    wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations
    were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of
    natural causes.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ivory-173">[173]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>The ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of Africa.<sup

    In January 2012, 650 elephants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba_Njida_National_Park"

    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup>
    This has been called "one of the worst concentrated killings" since the ivory ban.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-ivory-173">[173]</a></sup>
    Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack
    tusks. Still, members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas, such as <a

    China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal
    domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015, and in September 2015, China and
    the United States said "they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of
    ivory" due to causes of extinction.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>

    Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations. Because they need
    larger amounts of land than other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatry" >sympatric</a>
    terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases,
    elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes.
    Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food
    requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with
    humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these
    conflicts is important for conservation.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-IUCN2-170">[170]</a></sup> One

<p>Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with
    armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they
    were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the
    person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">[186]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"
>Mahabharata</a></i> (written in the 4th century BC, but said to
    describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as
    horse-drawn chariots by either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava" >Pandavas</a>
    or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaurava" >Kauravas</a>. During the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadha_Kingdom"  >Magadha
        Kingdom</a> (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater
    cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively;
    3,000 of them were used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_Empire" >Nandas</a>
    (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire"
    >Mauryan army</a> (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The <i><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra" >Arthashastra</a></i>
    (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild
    elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup>
    From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"
    >Persia</a><sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">[186]</a></sup>
    and east to Southeast Asia.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-SEA-188">[188]</a></sup>
    The Persians used them during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"
    >Achaemenid Empire</a> (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC)<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">[186]</a></sup>
    while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC
    and continued to the 20th century.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-SEA-188">[188]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>In his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"
>Alexander the Great</a> confronted elephants for the first
    time, and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file
    Macedonian soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies
    in India.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-:0-189">[189]</a></sup>
    Alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars
    with both the Persians and Indians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter"
    >Ptolemy</a>, who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of
    Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and
    successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_II_Philadelphus" >Ptolemy
        II</a> (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia" >Nubia</a>. From then on, war
    elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"
    >classical period</a>. The Greek king <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus"
    >Pyrrhus</a> used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in
    280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately
    lost the battle. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage" >Carthaginian</a>
    general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal" >Hannibal</a> took
    elephants across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps" >Alps</a> during
    his war with the Romans and reached the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_Valley" >Po
        Valley</a> in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani146-186">[186]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that
    their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants
    turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and Parthians.<sup

    >zoos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus" >circuses</a>
    around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus
    elephant was probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo" >Jumbo</a>
    (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringling_Bros._and_Barnum_%26_Bailey_Circus"
    >Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus</a>.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup>
    These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls
    and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common
    than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian
    elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the
    1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its
    captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.<sup

    As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The
    largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350

<p>Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they
    offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving
    their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals
    in zoos are under physical and mental stress.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup>
    Elephants have been recorded displaying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy_(non-human)"
    >stereotypical behaviours</a> in the form of swaying back and
    forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK
    zoos.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup>
    Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at
    only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the
    wild.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States"

    accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> In
    testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Jeffrey_Feld"
    >Kenneth Feld</a> acknowledged that circus
    elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped
    prods, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_goad" >bull
        hooks</a> or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus
    workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock
    device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any
    of these practices harm elephants.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup>

    humans.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-huggler-199">[199]</a></sup>
    In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s

<p>In many cultures, elephants represent strength, power, wisdom, longevity, stamina, leadership,
    sociability, nurturance and loyalty.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup><sup

    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup>
    Several cultural references emphasise the elephant's size and exotic uniqueness. For instance,
    a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant" >white elephant</a>"
    is a byword for something expensive, useless, and bizarre.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Van_Riper_73-208">[208]</a></sup>
    The expression "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room" >elephant
        in the room</a>" refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup>
    The story of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant" >blind
        men and an elephant</a> teaches that reality may be viewed by different perspectives.<sup

<p>Elephants have been represented in art since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic"
>Paleolithic</a> times. Africa, in particular, contains many rock
    paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara"
    >Sahara</a> and southern Africa.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> In Asia,
    the animals are depicted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)" >motifs</a>
    in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain"  >Jain</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" >Hindu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"
    >Buddhist</a> shrines and temples.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">[212]</a></sup>
    Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience with them.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" >ancient Romans</a>,
    who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic"
    >mosaics</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia" >Tunisia</a>
    and Sicily. At the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" >Middle
        Ages</a> when Europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed
    more like fantasy creatures. They were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with
    trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly
    featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture"
    >Gothic</a> churches. As more elephants began to be sent to
    European kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate,
    including one made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" >Leonardo
        da Vinci</a>. Despite this, some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised
    fashion.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ernst" >Max Ernst</a>'s 1921 <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism" >surrealist</a> painting,
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Celebes" >The
        Elephant Celebes</a>,</i> depicts an elephant as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo"
    >silo</a> with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbuti_people"
>Mbuti people</a> of central Africa believe that the souls of their
    dead ancestors resided in elephants.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">[212]</a></sup>
    Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation" >reincarnated</a>
    as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo-Ukwu"
    >Igbo-Ukwu</a>, near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta"
    >Niger Delta</a>, buried their leaders with elephant tusks.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup>
    The animals' religious importance is only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totemism"
    >totemic</a> in Africa<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup> but is much
    more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise
    in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airavata"
    >Airavata</a>, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and
    rainbows.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">[212]</a></sup>
    One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha"
    >Ganesha</a>, is ranked equal with the supreme gods <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva"
    >Shiva</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu" >Vishnu</a>,
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma" >Brahma</a>.<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup>
    Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people
    success as well as grant them their desires.<sup  ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">[212]</a></sup>
    In Buddhism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" >Buddha</a>
    is said to have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_(animal)" >white
        elephant</a> reincarnated as a human.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup>
    According to Buddhist mythology, Gautama Buddha's mother, Maya, dreamt that a white elephant
    enter her womb. The astrologers of the king's court interpreted this dream as the<sup
    ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup>
    impending birth of a great person who would either become a 'Chakravartin' (conqueror of the
    world) or a great sage. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" >Islamic</a>
    tradition, the year 570 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad" >Muhammad</a>
    was born is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Elephant" >Year
        of the Elephant</a>.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-221">[221]</a></sup>
    Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they
    worshipped the sun and stars.<sup  ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Shoshani158-212">[212]</a></sup>

<p>Elephants are ubiquitous in Western <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture"

    The use of the elephant as a symbol of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"

    As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally
    cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal
    human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit
    community, such as "The Elephant's Child" from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling"
